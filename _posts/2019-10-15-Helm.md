# Installation
1. Creating a Kubernetes cluster (1.6+ & RBAC)

Using kubectl config current-context or kubectl cluster-info for verification. (GCP k8s cluster)

2. Security
3. Helm(client) and Tiller(cluster side)

rbac-config.yaml
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: tiller
  namespace: kube-system
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: tiller
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: cluster-admin
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: tiller
    namespace: kube-system
```

```
kubectl create -f rbac-config.yaml

helm init --service-account tiller --history-max 200

helm init --upgrade

helm repo update

helm install stable/mysql
```

Whenever you install a chart, a new release is created. So one chart can be installed multiple times into the same cluster. And each can be independently managed and upgraded.

```
helm ls
```

# Pillars
## THREE BIG CONCEPTS
A Chart is a Helm package. It contains all of the resource definitions necessary to run an application, tool, or service inside of a Kubernetes cluster. Think of it like the Kubernetes equivalent of a Homebrew formula, an Apt dpkg, or a Yum RPM file.

A Repository is the place where charts can be collected and shared. It’s like Perl’s CPAN archive or the Fedora Package Database, but for Kubernetes packages.

A Release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. One chart can often be installed many times into the same cluster. And each time it is installed, a new release is created. Consider a MySQL chart. If you want two databases running in your cluster, you can install that chart twice. Each one will have its own release, which will in turn have its own release name.

With these concepts in mind, we can now explain Helm like this:

Helm installs charts into Kubernetes, creating a new release for each installation. And to find new charts, you can search Helm chart repositories.

### Search
```
helm search mysql
```

### Customizing

```
helm inspect values stable/mariadb

$ cat << EOF > config.yaml
mariadbUser: user0
mariadbDatabase: user0db
EOF
$ helm install -f config.yaml stable/mariadb
```

### Install
The helm install command can install from several sources:
* A chart repository (as we’ve seen above)
* A local chart archive (helm install foo-0.1.1.tgz)
* An unpacked chart directory (helm install path/to/foo)
* A full URL (helm install https://example.com/charts/foo-1.2.3.tgz)

### Upgrade
```
helm upgrade -f panda.yaml happy-panda stable/mariadb
```

### Rollback
```
helm rollback happy-panda 1
```

### Delete
```
helm delete happy-panda
```

### List
```
helm list --all
```

### Repo
```
helm repo list
```

```
helm repo add dev https://example.com/dev-charts
helm repo update
```

### Creation
```
helm create deis-workflow
```

### Package
```
helm package deis-workflow
helm install ./deis-workflow-0.1.0.tgz
```

## TILLER, NAMESPACES AND RBAC
In some cases you may wish to scope Tiller or deploy multiple Tillers to a single cluster. Here are some best practices when operating in those circumstances.

1. Tiller can be installed into any namespace. By default, it is installed into kube-system. You can run multiple Tillers provided they each run in their own namespace.

2. Limiting Tiller to only be able to install into specific namespaces and/or resource types is controlled by Kubernetes RBAC roles and rolebindings. You can add a service account to Tiller when configuring Helm via helm init --service-account <NAME>. You can find more information about that here.

3. Release names are unique PER TILLER INSTANCE.

4. Charts should only contain resources that exist in a single namespace.

5. It is not recommended to have multiple Tillers configured to manage resources in the same namespace.
