## Core headache
The configuration files, yaml files etc management on various clusters and hundreds of microservices, especially when migrating to another cluster.

## What is the Helm? (https://helm.sh/)
* Manage Kubernetes applications - Helm Charts -> define, install and upgrade
* Easy to create, version, share and publish -> No copy-and-paste (reproducible builds)
* Find and use popular software packaged as Helm charts to run in Kubernetes
* Share your own applications as Helm charts
* Intelligently manage your Kubernetes manifest files?

In short, think of helm like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

## Utilization
* create Charts
* pack charts into tgz format
* upload and download charts from charts museum(repo)
* installing chart in k8s
* manage releases of Helm packages


## How do we install softeware in Windows and Linux systems?

## Helm Charts
* Packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources
* Helm runs on your laptop, CI/CD (recommended), or wherever you want it to run
* Charts are Helm packages that contain at least two things:
  * A description of the package (Chart.yaml)
  * One or more templates, which contain Kubernetes manifest files
* Charts can be stored on disk, or fetched from remote chart repositories (like Debian or RedHat packages)

## Helm Architecture
* Two Component: client(helm) and server(tiller)
  * client:
    * local chart development
    * repo namagement
    * Tiller server interaction
    * search for release info
    * upgrade or uninstall existed release
  * server:
    * monitoring the Helm client request
    * release through charts
    * install chart into k8s and follow up the contimuous releases
    * upgrade or uninstall chart in k8s

In short, client manages the charts while server manages the release

* Tiller runs inside of your Kubernetes cluster, and manages releases (installations) of your charts instead of yaml files
